# Beanjot Text/Code Editor

Hey there, thanks for checking out my little text editor. It's pretty much the first actual
program I make coming from roblox luau, so don't expect the most clean/functional thing ever. It's mostly
made as a way to practice gdscript before actually starting work on an actual game.

Sorry ahead of time if the code isn't easy to read, i'm still trying to find a code structure i'm comfortable
with in godot, so i'm not entirely happy with how the code is organized but eh, at least it
works (I might come back to clean it up later, but for now it is what it is).

This is licensed under MIT, so feel free to do with it as you please. If you spot any bugs, innacuracies
with the syntax highlighting, etc. feel free to let me know (maybe i'll fix it, maybe I won't, this was
just a learning project so don't expect a lot of support).

## Some Features
* Modern/Classic layouts, in case you liked how notepad looked.
* A couple themes to customize the program to your liking.
* Syntax highlighting for GDScript, Lua and Roblox Luau.
* Localized in English and Spanish.
* Support for txt, lua and gd files.

## Downloads
* 32 Bits Version: https://github.com/JustBorgar/Beanjot/releases/download/release/Beanjot_32.exe
* 64 Bits Version (Untested): https://github.com/JustBorgar/Beanjot/releases/download/release/Beanjot_64.exe

## Never Asked Questions
* Q: Why is the filesize 69mb? that's too big!
  * A: That's the engine's filesize, the actual project file is around 2mb. I have no experience recompiling the engine to reduce it, so yeah, sorry about that.
* Q: Who's Caffeine Overflow? Repo is under a different name.
  * A: CF is an alias/brand name I use for consistency as I change my usernames often.
* Q: How do I access the project file?
  * A: Download the file from github, move it into your godot projects folder in documents, and open it with godot 4.0.2 (in the unlikely case you have any issues try the 32 bits version, that's the one it was made on)
* Q: How do I download the program?
  * A: From the downloads section right above this FAQ.
* Q: What can I use this for? Do I need to provide attribution?
  * A: Use the source files as you please, attribution is appreciated but not required.
* Q: I found a bug!
  * A: Feel free to report it, but as stated earlier, no promises it'll be fixed.
